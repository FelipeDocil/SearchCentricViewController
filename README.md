# SearchCentricViewController

Since Foursquare launched the version 10 I just get in love for the new Home screen, what they called Search Centric View Controller, so I decided to mimic and create a a custom View Controller.

This is just a beta project, if you want to use you must download and add to your own project and customize everything by youself.

# TODO

[] Create Datasource to customize with contents
[] Create Tests
[] Add to Cocoapods
